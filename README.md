# PartVerity
 A tool for managing custom parts in renewable energy projects.

 Custom orders in the energy industry often cause delays by requiring full assembly changes. I want to solve this by ensuring perfect part fits, keeping projects on schedule.

 This will be most useful for checking assemblies and seeing if parts fit or not ensuring everything that is going to production won't come back for rework.
